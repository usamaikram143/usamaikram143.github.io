Usama ikram Portfolio: https://usamaikram143.github.io/

I have used routers to create my portfolio website.

I have following routes:
- Home: The main page of the portfolio with a picture and name.
- About: The about page has some words about me and a link to my resume.
- Projects: The project page has some links to the projects I have worked on in the past.
- Contact: The contact page has my email address and some links to my other profiles.

Future plan: In the future whenever I will have more time to spend on it, I will work on the designing part, will try to make it look more eye catching. I will also add some other features to it and some animations.
